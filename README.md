# Tuto: How to implement a RPLidar on RaspberryPi 3B+ using ROS

##### Robot Project - CPE Lyon 2020 / 2021
###
### Created by Nicolas Guy on Mon 11/02/2021


This tutorial will show you how to implement a RPLidar on a RasberryPi 3B+ using ROS. All the test have been done on Ubuntu 18.04 and ROS Kinetic. 

Setting used:
  - Ubuntu 18.04
  - ROS Kinetic
  - Catkin

### What is a RP Lidar ?
> RPLIDAR is a low cost 2D LIDAR solution developed by RoboPeak Team, SlamTec company. It canscan 360Â° environment within 6 meter radius. The output of RPLIDAR is very suitable to build map, do slam, or build 3D model.

### First step how to connect the RPLidar ?

Find a micro USB Cable and stick it in the USB port. Then connect the "5 cables" from the Lidar to the microcontroller hub. Finally, connect the USB cable to the RaspberryPi 3B+.

### Prepare your Ros Worspace and package

### Installation

```sh 
mkdir rplidar_ws
cd rplidar_ws
mkdir src
cd src
sudo git clone https://github.com/Slamtec/rplidar_ros.git
cd ~/rplidar_ws/
catkin_make
```
The build can take a lot of time, be patient and don't do anything during the catkin_make

After that, you have to source your bashrc with this command
```
source devel/setup.bash
```

### Activate the serial USB port

You need to activate the serial USB port of your RaspberryPi 3B+ for being able to connect the Lidar via USB. To do this your need to write the command:

```
sudo chmod 666 /dev/SERIAL_USED
```

To find the serial you are using you can use this command below. Most of the time it is ttyUSB0

```
ls -l /dev|grep ttyUSB
```

### Time to run the Lidar:

You just have to run the launcher you downloaded on the github from Slamtec and you should have your first mapping. (It is preferable to start a roscore on another terminal before)

    roslaunch rplidar_ros view_rplidar.launch
    
  - rpllidar_ros is the package
  - view_rplidar.launch is the launcher

At this point you should have Rviz running, the Lidar moving and your first mapping on Rviz.
